Notes from intro to git lesson:

 - When you first create a new repo and you want to clone it follow these steps:
  1. Make sure you have an ssh key set up so you can clone it using ssh.
  2. do git clone <ssh link copied from github repo>

 - git status -> shows files that need to be staged or are currently in the staging area.
 - git commit -m -> commits staged files with a message 
 - git log -> Shows history of actions for current repo 
 - git push -> Pushes commits to repo

 Branches:
  - to make a new branch and switch to it -> git checkout -b <branch name>
  - to push new branch to GitHub -> git push origin rps-ui
  - to merge branch to main -> git merge
  - to delete old branch after it has been merged -> git branch -d <branch_name> (if it has been merged) or git branch -D <branch_name> (if it hasnt been merged)
