Notes from intro to git lesson:

 - When you first create a new repo and you want to clone it follow these steps:
  1. Make sure you have an ssh key set up so you can clone it using ssh.
  2. do git clone <ssh link copied from github repo>

 - git status -> shows files that need to be staged or are currently in the staging area.
 - git commit -m -> commits staged files with a message 
 - git log -> Shows history of actions for current repo 
 - git push -> Pushes commits to repo
