Git commit messages:
  7 rules:
    1. Seperate subject from the body with a blank line
    2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters 
    3. Capitalize the subject line
    4. Do not end the subject line with a period 
    5. use the imperative mood in the subject line (it should sound like you
    are giving a command like "clean your room")

    Pro tip:
    A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete 
    the following sentence: If applied, this commit will your subject line here

    If applied, this commit will your subject line here
    6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
    7. Use the body to explain what and whys vs how

git commit -m "some message"
  mainly useful for short fixes that dont need a lot of 
  explanation such as "Updated readme". However, if the a 
  commit needs a lengthy message use a text editor
