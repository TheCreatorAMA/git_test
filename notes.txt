Notes from intro to git lesson:

 - When you first create a new repo and you want to clone it follow these steps:
  1. Make sure you have an ssh key set up so you can clone it using ssh.
  2. do git clone <ssh link copied from github repo>

 - git status -> shows files that need to be staged or are currently in the staging area.
 - git commit -m -> commits staged files with a message 
 - git log -> Shows history of actions for current repo 
 - git push -> Pushes commits to repo

<<<<<<< HEAD
 Branches:
  - to make a new branch and switch to it -> git checkout -b <branch name>
  - to push new branch to GitHub -> git push origin rps-ui
  - to merge branch to main -> git merge
  - to delete old branch after it has been merged -> git branch -d <branch_name> (if it has been merged) or git branch -D <branch_name> (if it hasnt been merged)

Git commit messages:
  7 rules:
    1. Seperate subject from the body with a blank line
    2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters 
    3. Capitalize the subject line
    4. Do not end the subject line with a period 
    5. use the imperative mood in the subject line (it should sound like you
    are giving a command like "clean your room")

    Pro tip:
    A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete 
    the following sentence: If applied, this commit will your subject line here

    If applied, this commit will your subject line here
    6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
    7. Use the body to explain what and whys vs how

git commit -m "some message"
  mainly useful for short fixes that dont need a lot of 
  explanation such as "Updated readme". However, if the a 
  commit needs a lengthy message use a text editor 

merging branches:
  Workflow to merge branches:
    - git checkout <branch you wnat other branch to merge into>
    - git merge <branch you want to merge into current branch>
    - git push origin main
    - git branch -d rps-ui and git push --delete origin rps-ui to remove branch from local version and remote
